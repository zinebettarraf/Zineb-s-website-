summary: The main aim of this project is to provide a visual representation of the embeddings generated by BERT sentence encoder, enabling a better understanding of the semantic relationships between sentences. By applying dimensionality reduction techniques and plotting the embeddings in a reduced-dimensional space, the visualization allows for intuitive exploration and interpretation of the similarities and differences among sentences .
