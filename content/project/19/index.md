summary: The data challenge I tackled is a multi class classification problem that aims to predict the right class among the 20 existing classes. The data available in this work is a subset of Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 dataset (you can find it here). The data in our hands is divided between 1082 training images, 103 images for validation and 517 test images.
