title : Some Advanced Kernel ML models from scratch

---

This project focused on implementing advanced kernel machine learning models from scratch, specifically Kernel Principal Component Analysis (Kernel PCA) and Kernel Support Vector Machines (Kernel SVM). By developing these models from scratch, we gained a deep understanding of their underlying principles and intricate mathematical formulations. Kernel PCA allowed us to extract nonlinear features from the data using kernel functions, enabling more robust dimensionality reduction. Kernel SVM, on the other hand, empowered us to classify data points in nonlinearly separable datasets by mapping them to a higher-dimensional space using kernel functions. Through this project, we honed our skills in implementing and fine-tuning these advanced kernel ML models, expanding our knowledge and expertise in this domain.
