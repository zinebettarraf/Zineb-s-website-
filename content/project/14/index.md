summary: This project involved the implementation of several advanced kernel machine learning models entirely from scratch. Notable models included in the implementation were the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, perceptron algorithm, linear least-squares regression, logistic regression, and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP).

title : Some ML models from scratch
---
This project involved the implementation of several advanced kernel machine learning models entirely from scratch. Notable models included in the implementation were the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, perceptron algorithm, linear least-squares regression, logistic regression, and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP). Overall, this project provided a valuable opportunity to delve into the inner workings of these advanced kernel ML models and expand our proficiency in their implementation and optimization.
