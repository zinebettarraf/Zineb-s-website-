title: Simulation of complex particulate systems
---
This project focuses on building simulations of complex particulate systems at various scales. It aims to demonstrate proficiency in C++ concepts such as classes, pointers, references, and operators.

Throughout the project, the main goal was to enhance the performance of the code by optimizing algorithmic choices and selecting efficient data structures. This involved making strategic decisions to improve the efficiency of the simulations and achieve faster execution times.

By optimizing the algorithmic choices, we aimed to reduce unnecessary computations and streamline the simulation process. Additionally, careful selection of data structures allowed for efficient storage and manipulation of the particulate system data.

Overall, this project required a deep understanding of C++ concepts and the ability to leverage them effectively to enhance the performance of the code. It provided an opportunity to demonstrate mastery in optimizing algorithmic choices and selecting appropriate data structures for complex simulations of particulate systems.
