summary: The project is interested in modeling parametric curves interpolating a set of points using Hermite cubic splines, with tangents estimated by Cardinal splines at first, then by two other estimates of the tangents (Hermite_v1 and Hermite_v2), then we have moved to Lagrange interpolation, and finally to cubic splines C2 .
