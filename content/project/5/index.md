title: Web application for activity reports o4act
---
During my summer internship, it was essential for employees, especially trainees working on various tasks, to submit daily activity reports to their managers. These reports included a summary of completed tasks and an action plan for upcoming assignments. Unfortunately, relying on email for report submissions posed a significant challenge. With the reports getting lost among the multitude of emails, managers found it arduous to keep track of them effectively. This predicament sparked the idea of developing a web application called o4act.
